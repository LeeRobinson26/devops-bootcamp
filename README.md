The "Brand Builder" (Visionary &amp; Ambitious) Engineering the Foundation: A journey through SRE and Platform Engineering principles. This repository documents the automation, security, and infrastructure patterns I’m mastering to empower the next generation of engineers.

# DevOps & Platform Engineering Bootcamp 🚀
### Journey to SRE & Platform Mastery

Welcome to my DevOps Bootcamp repository! This project serves as a comprehensive record of my technical growth. 

Beyond just completing exercises, I am building this as the foundational "Single Source of Truth" for my transition into specialized Platform Engineering and SRE roles.

## 📂 Project Structure Highlights

### [01-OS-Linux-Basics](./01-os-linux-basics)
* **Focus:** Mastering the CLI and Shell Scripting.
* **Key Exercise:** Created a robust Java installation and version-check script using `awk` and `bash` logic.

### [05-Nexus-Artifact-Repo](./05-nexus-artifact-repo)
* **Focus:** Managing the software supply chain.
* **Key Exercise:** Setting up hosted/proxy repositories to ensure "Build Once, Deploy Many" consistency.

*(Note: Link these headers to your actual folders once they are created!)*

## 💡 Professional Philosophy
As a future Platform Engineer, I believe in:
1.  **Immutability:** Moving from "pet" servers to "cattle" via Packer and Nexus.
2.  **Observability:** If it isn't monitored (Prometheus), it doesn't exist.
3.  **Security by Default:** Using Hashicorp Vault and hardened images from day one.
